I can't imagine what these last four years would have been like without the guidance, wisdom, and continual support and friendship of my adviser, Dr. Joan Garfield. Thank you for your ever-open door and your never-ending encouragement. I would also like to thank my other committee members: Dr. Michael Harwell, Dr. Frances Lawrenz, and Dr. Lesa Clarkson for continuing to fan the flame of academic rigor in this work. Also, a special thank you to Dr. Jeffrey Long for his counsel and methodological input.

I would like to thank my parents, Frederick and Margaret Zieffler, for instilling in me an academic curiosity and love of knowledge that were essential ingredients on this journey. I would also like to thank my sister and brother-in-law, Sandra and Scott Kutscher, for their support during the last four years. And, a special thank you to my girlfriend, Lauren Anderson, who not only helped keep a constant coffee supply in the house, but more importantly put up with me during the writing of this thesis.

Finally, there is no way I could have ever endured graduate school without the support and friendship of so many people. Ann Ooms and Anne Betzner---I wouldn’t have shared the trials and successes of graduate school with anyone else; Tim, Angela, Greg and Laura---I can't say enough\ldots thank you all; Jeff Harring---This thesis would never have even begun if not for the multitudes of conversations, support, prodding, kidding, sports analyses, and bemusements that accompanied our caffeination on an almost daily basis at the Purple Onion. Words can’t express how grateful I am that you have become one of my best friends. Thanks again.
